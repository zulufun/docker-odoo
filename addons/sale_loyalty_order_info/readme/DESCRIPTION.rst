This module provides more info on the applied loyalty rewards on a sale order.
It provides:
* The total reward amount, computed tax included;
* A list of the applied promo codes;
* All generated coupons from this sale order;
* All programs applied to the sale order.

The main goal is to use these info for reporting, so they are not added in views, as it would trigger additional computations.
