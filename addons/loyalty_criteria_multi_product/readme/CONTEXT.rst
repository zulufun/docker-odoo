The functionality of the "Repeat" option that was included in this module is now included
in the rules of an odoo promotion. In this functionality a criterion was established in
which any of the products defined in the list of the criterion itself had to be in the
sales order lines in the minimum quantity established for the promotion to be applied.
This functionality can now be applied in the following way:

- Defining or editing a promotion.
- Modifying the rules to indicate a minimum quantity and selecting the products,
  either by domain, specific products, product category or tag.

This way the promotion will be applicable when any of those products are in the order l
ines and the total of all or one of them meets the minimum quantity, as it was done when
the "Repeat" option was checked.
