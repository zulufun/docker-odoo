This module is created in v16 because in v15 there was a field rule_date_from to set the
start date of a promotion in the coupon_program module and in v16 this field disappears
and there is no other field to replace it. This is why it was decided to add the
date_from field at promotion level as well as the date_to field and recover this
functionality.
