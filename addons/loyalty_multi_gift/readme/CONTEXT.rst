For the 'buy_x_get_y' type promotion, the 'Reward_type' field is restricted to the 'Product'
option only and the possibility to select 'Multigift' is disabled. This restriction is implemented
because, in this scenario, the 'reward_type' field becomes 'readonly'.

It is crucial to note that modifying the values displayed in this field to set different
values according to the type of promotion may generate conflicts with other modules that
contribute to the configuration of this same field. Therefore, it is recommended not to
alter these values directly, as this may affect the consistency and functionality of other
components of the system.

To configure similar promotions, it is suggested to modify another type of promotion by
adapting its rules and rewards according to specific needs. This provides a more secure
and consistent way to manage custom configurations without compromising the integrity of
the system.
