To configure multiple product criterias:

#. Go to *Sales > Product > Loyalty Programs* and select or create a new one.
#. Go to rules. On the *Loyalty Criteria* field choose *Multi Product*.
#. The standard domain will be hidden and a criteria list will be shown.
#. Add as many criterias as needed for the desired promotion behavior.

In the list of criterias we can configure:

- Products: The products that should be present to fulfill the condition.

Some examples:

===== ================
  Qty      Products
===== ================
    1   Prod A
===== ================

A unit of Product A must be in the sale order.

===== ================
  Qty      Products
===== ================
    2   Prod B, Prod C
===== ================

A unit of Product B and Product C must be in the sale order.

Also note that all the defined criterias must be fulfilled or the program won't be
applied.
